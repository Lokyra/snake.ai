## About The Project

Snake AI is an implementation of the classic Snake game with a reinforcement learning agent that learns to play the game optimally. The project uses PyTorch to create a Deep Q-Learning model that improves its gameplay through experience.

## Features

- Classic Snake game implementation with PyGame
- Deep Q-Learning neural network using PyTorch
- Real-time training visualization
- Performance tracking with matplotlib
- Both human playable and AI training modes

    R1[Eat Food: +10]
    R2[Game Over: -10]
    R3[Survive: 0]
    end
```
## Traning process 

The agent uses an epsilon-greedy strategy for exploration :

- Initial random moves for exploration
- Gradually transitions to exploitation of learned patterns
- Stores experiences in memory
- Trains in both short-term and long-term memory phases
